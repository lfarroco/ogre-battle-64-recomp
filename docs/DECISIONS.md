## 2026-08-25 (session 4) — First RSP task + real VI mode: boot is past the libultra bridge

### Decision: correct osSendMesg/osJamMesg identification

Session 3 named `0x800935A0 = osSendMesg`, but that function does a **front
insert** (`mq->first = (first+msgCount-1) % msgCount`), i.e. `osJamMesg`. The
game's real back-insert `osSendMesg` is `func_80093810` (36 call sites; the
audio/event request system uses it). Renaming `func_80093810 = osSendMesg`
makes audio-request responses go through the runtime's `osSendMesg`, which
**wakes blocked threads** — the missing piece that let the game thread proceed
past its first audio request.

### Decision: add an external-message drainer thread to the runtime

With VI events being delivered every frame, the boot still deadlocked: the
runtime only drains its external-message queue when a game thread calls
`osSendMesg`/`osRecvMesg`, and OB64's boot blocks every game thread on a queue
fed by the VI retrace event (its main thread busy-spins). Added a hidden
"drainer" game thread in `librecomp/src/recomp.cpp` (spawned after
`on_init_callback`) that loops `wait_for_external_message` +
`check_running_queue`. It must be **lower** priority (5) than the threads it
wakes, because this runtime schedules **higher** priority numbers first —
priority 30 starved the game thread (pri 10) in the running queue.

### Decision: name the osCont family, timers, events, and osSpGetStatus

- The PFS (Controller-Pak) cluster at `0x80096B90+` is *not* the osCont family
  (`__osSumcalc`/`__osIdCheckSum` etc.); the osCont cluster is the SI-touching
  one at `0x800900C0..0x800906C0`. Named `osContInit`, `osContStartQuery`,
  `osContGetQuery`, `osContStartReadData`, `osContGetReadData`.
- Timers: `osGetTime` 0x80094C90, `osSetTime` 0x80094D20, `osSetTimer`
  0x80094D40 (the handoff's `0x80094E34` is the timer *interrupt handler*, not
  osSetTimer).
- Events: `osViSetEvent` 0x80095560 and `osSetEventMesg` 0x80093940 — the game
  registered its VI-retrace→audio-queue message (0x29A) through its verbatim
  osViSetEvent, so the runtime never delivered it.
- `osSpGetStatus` 0x800939F0: the RSP task threads busy-wait on SP_STATUS; not
  dead code as session 3 assumed. Added to N64Recomp's `reimplemented_funcs`
  (N64RecompCLI rebuild required) + runtime `osSpGetStatus_recomp` (returns
  SP_STATUS_HALTED).

### Outcome

The game boots without crashing for the full observed window (~25 s), submits
its **first RSP gfx task** (`send_dl frame=1 type=1`), and sets a **real VI
mode** (dummy workloads stop; the null renderer swaps the game's framebuffers
at ~50-60 Hz). Next watch point: the streamed-code ROM DMA (`func_8009DA50`)
before Phase 4 overlay loading.

## 2026-08-24 (session 3) — First boot achieved: libultra bridging is working

### Decision: name-based libultra replacement confirmed and applied (3 batches)

Applied 24 names to `symbol_addrs.txt` (see `LIBULTRA-BRIDGING.md` "Progress").
The boot path now runs the runtime's native `osXxx_recomp` services:
`osInitialize`, `osCreateThread`/`osStartThread`/`osSetThreadPri`/
`osGetThreadPri`, `osCreateMesgQueue`/`osSendMesg`/`osRecvMesg`,
`osCreatePiManager`/`osCartRomInit`, `osSetIntMask`,
`osAiGetLength`/`osAiGetStatus`/`osAiSetFrequency`/`osAiSetNextBuffer`,
`osSpTaskLoad`/`osSpTaskStartGo`/`osSpTaskYield`/`osSpTaskYielded`,
`osCreateViManager`/`osViSetMode`/`osViSetSpecialFeatures`/`osViSwapBuffer`/
`osViGetCurrentFramebuffer`/`osViGetNextFramebuffer`, `osDpSetNextBuffer`,
`osGetCount`, `__osSetFpcCsr`, `osVirtualToPhysical`.

**Outcome:** the game **boots without crashing** on Linux — 7 N64 threads start,
the null renderer swaps VI buffers at ~50-60 Hz, and the game runs its init.
No MMIO shim (handoff option 3) was needed; naming the RSP-task family made the
remaining verbatim MMIO readers (`osSpGetStatus`, `osSpSetStatus`,
`__osAiDeviceBusy`, `osSiGetStatus`, `osDpGetStatus`) unreachable dead code.

### Decision: fix the runtime's initial-1MB DMA sign-extension bug

`recomp::init()` passed the entrypoint VRAM address to `do_rom_read` as a
zero-extended `uint64_t`, but recompiled memory accesses expect sign-extended
32-bit addresses (the `MEM_B`/`MEM_W` macros subtract `0xFFFFFFFF80000000`).
The DMA wrote ~4 GiB past rdram, so the game's data section never loaded and a
later verbatim VI helper null-deref'd. Fixed by sign-extending:

```cpp
recomp::do_rom_read(rdram, (gpr)(int32_t)entrypoint, 0x10001000, 0x100000);
```

This is a genuine N64ModernRuntime bug that other projects would hit with a
high `0x800xxxxx` entrypoint; our fix stays local to the vendored runtime.

### Decision: new analysis tool

Added `tools/libultra_scan.py` — parses `asm/1060.s` and reports, per function:
MMIO registers, cop0 registers, and direct callees. This replaces the one-off
manual scans with a reproducible inventory.

### Next session (see `docs/HANDOFF-2026-08-24.md` / `LIBULTRA-BRIDGING.md`)

- Name the `osCont*` family (`osContInit` etc.) — the game may be waiting on
  controller init; the game thread has not yet hit streamed-code stubs or
  submitted RSP tasks in the observed window.
- Watch for the first RSP task and the game's first real `osViSetMode`
  (the null renderer currently shows the runtime's dummy framebuffers).

## 2026-08-24 (session 2) — Libultra bridging: name-based replacement + platform decision

### Decision: adopt handoff Option 1 — name OB64's libultra functions in the ELF

The next milestone (see `LIBULTRA-BRIDGING.md`) is to make the runtime's native
`osXxx_recomp` services replace OB64's verbatim libultra. Mechanism is purely
name-based in N64Recomp (`reimplemented_funcs`), so the work is building the
OB64 libultra **address→name table** and adding it to `symbol_addrs.txt`,
then re-splat → rebuild ELF → re-run `make recomp`.

Rejected for now:
- **MMIO shim first (handoff option 3)**: only to be used surgically for
  registers the game still reads after reimplementation.
- **Address-based N64Recomp config**: viable fallback, but the canonical
  `symbol_addrs.txt` route also names the disassembly for future debugging.
- **Skipping the game's libultra entirely (option 4)**: too risky.

### Decision: this milestone is macOS- and Linux-equivalent; switch for the renderer phase

The libultra-bridging work is CPU-side and platform-independent — no reason to
switch machines for it. The RT64/renderer phase should move to Ubuntu (Vulkan
primary backend). Documented in `guides/linux-migration.md` with the exact
macOS-specific code to remove (`app/CMakeLists.txt` APPLE blocks, the
`__APPLE__` branch in `sdl_platform.cpp::create_window`, the RT64 DXC `libz.dylib`
symlink, Metal toolchain download).

### Decision: correct the function count

PLAN.md's "3659 functions" is stale; the recompiled output has **807 functions**
(802 `func_800xxxxx` + `main_recomp`/`recomp_entrypoint`/others).

---

## 2026-08-24 — Phase 3: first-boot app

### Decision: static recompilation pipeline (unchanged, restated)

Confirmed the project continues on the `N64Recomp` + `N64ModernRuntime` stack
(Zelda 64: Recompiled approach), not a matching decomp.

### Decision: app project layout

- New `app/` CMake project produces the `ogrebattle64` executable.
- `RecompiledFuncs/*.c` (recompiler output) is compiled into a static lib
  (`ogrebattle64_recomp`) and linked into the app.
- `tools/N64ModernRuntime` (ultramodern + librecomp) and `tools/RT64` are pulled
  in via `add_subdirectory`.
- `tools/RecompFrontend` (RmlUi-based menu UI) is intentionally **not** used yet;
  it adds heavy dependencies (RmlUi, lunasvg, GamepadMotion) and is only needed
  for the config/mod menu (Phase 7). Input is wired directly via SDL2 for now.

Rationale: keep the first-boot milestone minimal and debuggable. Adding the
frontend later is purely additive.

### Decision: RT64 as the renderer

RT64 (MIT) is the recommended renderer for N64ModernRuntime projects and the
same one used by Zelda64Recomp. It interprets RDP commands and provides the
`RendererContext` used by ultramodern. Added as submodule at `tools/RT64`.

Build options (same as Zelda64Recomp): `RT64_STATIC=ON`, `RT64_SDL_WINDOW_VULKAN=ON`,
`HLSL_CPU` compile definition. On macOS RT64 uses its **Metal** backend (the
`RT64_SDL_WINDOW_VULKAN` option is only meaningful on Linux).

### Decision: phased bring-up (null renderer first)

The app is structured so the renderer is swappable. For the first boot
validation we use a **null renderer** that:
- acknowledges VI register updates and display-list submissions without drawing,
- logs boot progress (VI swaps, RSP tasks, thread activity).

Rationale: Ogre Battle 64 renders everything through RDP, and RDP commands only
exist after the game's RSP microcode is recompiled. A null renderer lets us
validate the whole boot path (thread scheduler, libultra shims, PI DMA) before
RT64/RSP work lands; it also avoids coupling renderer bring-up with microcode
bring-up.

### Decision: ROM hash constant

`GameEntry.rom_hash` uses XXH3-64 of the full big-endian ROM
(`librecomp` hashes the post-byteswap contents):

```
XXH3_64(assets/ogre64.z64) = 0xbe6adaa5c3f8f7a9
```

### Decision: entrypoint

`GameEntry.entrypoint_address = 0x80070C00` (cart header entry), entrypoint
function = `recomp_entrypoint` (recompiled boot stub). `recomp::init()` already
handles IPL3 variable setup and the initial 1MB ROM DMA, and the boot stub
clears BSS and jumps to the game's `main_recomp`.

### Decision: streamed/overlay code stubs during bring-up

Functions outside the ELF (`0x8016C900+`, `0x84001120+`, etc.) are referenced
via runtime `get_function` lookups, which hard-fail if a function is unknown.
Until Phase 4 implements real overlay loading, the app registers **log-and-return
stubs** for all unresolved addresses via `recomp::overlays::add_loaded_function`.
This lets the boot path survive early references to streamed code.

## 2026-08-24 — First boot findings (critical)

### Decision: record the MMIO / libultra-verbatim problem

The app now builds and boots the runtime, but the game crashes on its first
hardware access:

- `recomp::mem_size` is **512 MiB** (not GB); the recompiled `MEM_W` macro maps
  MMIO reads like `0xA4800018` (SI status) to `rdram + ~0x24800000`
  (~580 MiB), which is outside the RW region → SIGBUS.
- More fundamentally, OB64's libultra is recompiled **verbatim** (generic
  `func_800xxxxx` symbols), so N64Recomp's name-based libultra reimplementation
  never fired and the runtime's `osXxx_recomp` services are not called by the
  game. Bridging this (see `HANDOFF-2026-08-24.md` options 1–4) is the next
  milestone.

### Decision: `start_game` must be delayed

Calling `recomp::start_game` before `recomp::start` makes the VI thread skip
its dummy-mode phase and crash on a null VI mode. The app now starts the game
from a thread delayed 500 ms.


### Decision: SDL2 dependency

The app uses SDL2 for window/input/audio. On macOS it is provided by Homebrew
(`brew install sdl2`, which today installs `sdl3` + `sdl2-compat`).

### Decision: licensing

- N64Recomp: MIT
- N64ModernRuntime: GPL-3.0
- RT64: MIT
- RecompFrontend: (see repo)

Because N64ModernRuntime is GPL-3.0 and is statically linked, the final
`ogrebattle64` app is **GPL-3.0**.
